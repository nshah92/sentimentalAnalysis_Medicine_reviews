# sentimentalAnalysis_Medicine_reviews
The purpose of this project was to examine the similarities and difference of generic and
brand name drugs. In order to achieve this goal, we used online medicine reviews from different
websites such as drugs.com and webmd.com. The reviews gathered from these websites were used
to capture the patientsâ€™ experiences by way of finding sentiment in their reviews with regards to
the statement being positive, negative, or neutral. A sentimental analysis was performed on
reviews of generic and brand name medications used to treat high blood pressure. Results of this
analysis were demonstrated with multiple line graphs, which gave a better indication of the
sentiments. Furthermore, analysis of the reviews gathered was used to produce the most common
positive and negative statements, which reflect the main reason that consumers liked or disliked a
particular medication. This was performed by capturing the catchphrases that were most often
repeated in consumer reviews.
